# News Summarizer and Talk-to-Speech Model

This project fetches news articles about a company, summarizes them, performs sentiment analysis, extracts key topics, and converts the summaries into Hindi audio. It has two versions: a web application using Streamlit and an API server using FastAPI.

## Features
- Fetches news articles from Google News.
- Summarizes articles into three sentences.
- Performs sentiment analysis (Happy, Sad, or Neutral).
- Extracts three main topics from each summary.
- Converts summaries and overall analysis to Hindi audio.
- Provides a web interface (Streamlit) or an API (FastAPI).

## Project Structure
- **`app.py`** - Streamlit application for an interactive UI.
- **`api.py`** - FastAPI server for API-based access.
- **`utils.py`** - Helper functions for fetching, summarizing, sentiment analysis, etc.
- **`requirements.txt`** - List of required dependencies.
- **`README.md`** - Documentation.

## Tech Stack
### Languages
- **Python** (Version 3.7+ recommended)
